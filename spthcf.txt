*spank the calf*
*Satyrn*

aging minds mired in toil
not tired 
of struggle
sympathize

sentiment said aloud
my heart sweats in the crowd

so pry my eyes from the technoscreen thieves
i look up to the sky
and i see that she bleeds

the lodestone lodged in my mind
led me to find
that despite all my prying
my life has been lived in vain

my minds memories
altered and buried by pain

i struggle and falter
through the shrine that remains

cursed wisdom of god's tears
the cries of a saint

eighty miles 
mild romance cannot steer

getting harder to feel
getting drunk off of fear

remember the years
in a park with some peers

you're all lost to me now
on par with the crowd

and even as the other people seem to fade away,
i see you in my sleep and in my eyes just as i wake

and even as the other people seem to fade away

and even as the other people seem to fade away,
i see you in my sleep and in my eyes just as i wake

You can't fade

and even as the other people seem to fade away,
i see you in my sleep and in my eyes just as i wake

and even as the other people seem to fade away

and even as the other people seem to fade away,
i see you in my sleep and in my eyes just as i wake
